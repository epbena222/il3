<h1> styling with CSS</h1>
<br>
<h2>this webpage is a basic html 5 webpage but linked to a cascading style sheet or CSS document for short. there is two main types of CSS the is inline styling wich hase all the text and styling in one document and there is the style sheet witch has all the styling on a seperate documen.i will be showing you how to uses standar CSS on a seperate document.</h2>
<br>
<h2>long story short css is used for telling a webpage how to look and to devide it up into sections.</h2>
    <br>
<h2>
    a basic css file will look simaler to this:
    <br>
    <br>
    h1 {
    <br>
    font-size: 25px;
    <br>
    }
    <br>
    h2 {
    <br>
    Font-color: #fff;
    <br>
    }
</h2>    
<h2>
    The main benefit of using css is the ability to create classes which allows for simplification of code for example you could have the css class class1 that sets the font size to 50px, now instead of having to write out font-size: 50px every time you want a line to be 50px you can write it once on the css document and than assign certain html tags to that class. Overall this allows for simpler code which is better code
